		//can collide with
		
		//field *hits* is an arraylist of GameObjects that stores the objects this object
		//has collided with this frame. It will be updated each frame using this method
			//in addition, however, it will store any hits calculated by other objects
			//that checked collision before this one.
		
		//field *checks* is an arraylist of GameObjects that stores the objects this object
		//has already been checked by (to avoid double checks)
		
		//CollisionManager.checkBoxes(this, categories, checks.toArray());
			//checkBoxes will first load all the checks that have been calculated
			//by previous collision checks (no double checking)
		
			//checkBoxes will then loop through categories
				//for each, it will loop through all objects in that category,
				//ignoring any objects that have already been checked (whether 
				//they were hits or not). It will do this by searching checks[].
		
				//It will compare this collision box with each (supersampling as
				//necessary). Any hits will be stored in an arraylist. This arraylist
				//will contain all objects from all valid categories that collided
				//this object this frame.
			
			//When all hits in all valid categories have been calculated,
			//an array will be returned to this object using the arraylist's toArray() 
			//method. It will be appended to the hits arraylist.
		
		//GameObjects will then finally run through the returned list and handle each
		//hit in hits[] accordingly using the handleHits() method. GameObjects will not have
		//implemented this method. That's for the subclasses like Player, Hitbox, and Muss
		//to do.
		
		//finally, hits will be initialized back to 0 to prepare for the next frame
